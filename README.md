This is a demonstration of application security engineering and vulnerability management.
A slice of an application is coded and initalized with an intentionally vulnerable resource.

A resource is detailed in the source code and exploited with a proof of concept (python primarily where possible) 
The secure code / code review (patch) is outlined in the source code and remediated.
